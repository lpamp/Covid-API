#population
#A fraction of total amount to determine 
#proportion = from fraction to decimal 
#percentage = from decimal(proportions) * 100 


#percentage  = confirmed / population * 100 
 
#*****per capita******

#Percentage by per capita 



#before, it would be unequal to compare because
#i.e india vs us: india has more in pop than us.
#To equal the playing field, get rid of population and turn it into per capita 

#per capita would be per 100,000 people in a country



#example 34.1M India v 150K Australia

#Per capita percentage * x amount of people compared 

# Australia 150,000/ 25,700,000 = 0.584% = 
#0.00584 * per 100,000 people = 584
# India 34,100 / 1,380,000 = 2.471%
# 0.0247 * per 100,000 people = 2471

#proportion = decimal number of a ratio/fraction\
